#### Interpretation Module

For those that already have the ARTP Foundation Certificate, successful completion of this course with ARTP registration, will have the same weighting as the ARTP Full Certificate in Spirometry.

This course can also be taken by clinicians who do not perfrom spirometry but need to interpret it, therefore requiring the knowledge on how to do this effectively as well as a background of understanding. This is a 1 day course.
