# New regulations for diagnostic spirometry

Healthcare professionals who intend to perform and interpret quality assured diagnostic spirometry (QADS) will have to be certified as competent to either perform spirometry, interpret the results, or both and placed on a national register with a reaccreditation scheme to ensure ongoing competency. This scheme, implemented by NHS England, gives practitioners until 31st March 2021 to complete this process and ensure that they are on this register. ARTP were asked to hold this national register.

If you are a CCG, or private company and would like to commission our services, please contact us on info@respiratorymatters.com

#### ARTP/BTS approved Spirometry Courses

Our ARTP accredited spirometry courses are suitable for any health care professional involved in the performance and/or interpretation of spirometry. This includes those working in Primary Care, Secondary Care, Physiologists, technicians and those working in an occupational health setting. As well as attending the spirometry study days, if you need to be placed on the national register to comply with regulations within your workplace, you will also need to register with ARTP. Once registered, ARTP will send you details of your assignments and assessments which are completed after attending the study days. On successful completion of the assessments you will receive the relevant certificate from ARTP and be included on the National Register of Certified Professional and Operators. The courses on offer are the  Foundation module - performance (1 day),  interpretation module (1 day) and the Full course (2 days), and spirometry refresher course (1 day) Further details of assessment can be found at www.artp.org.uk
