Currently awaiting approval, Respiratory Matters will soon be able to deliver three seperate Diploma courses in Asthma, COPD and Spirometry. 

These courses will be delivered in your locality, at mutually agreed times, to ease the difficulties that can arise when working and studying at the same time. To register your interest please contact us.
