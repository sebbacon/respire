### ARTP competency assessment and entry onto the spirometry register

Whilst it is NOT a mandatory requirement, if delegates wish to complete the ARTP competencies and be placed on the National Register, our course content will prepare you for this, and can be included as part of our training package. You can also complete the course first and then enrol yourself with ARTP at a later date. We would still support you through the process.

Our spirometry courses have all been accredited by the CPD certification service. Accredited CPD training means the learning activity has reached the required Continuing Professional Development standards and benchmarks. The learning value has been scrutinised to ensure integrity and quality. The CPD Certification Service provides recognised independent CPD accreditation compatible with global CPD requirements. Competency assessments are included within our course structure which are independant of those set by ARTP. The course content follows ARTP quality assurance standards. 

Courses can be completed via distance learning with face to face study days or via e-learning with optional ZOOM tutorials.

If you are a CCG, ICB, PCN or private company and would like to commission our services, please contact us on info@respiratorymatters.com to discuss your requirements. Discounts are available.


## Spirometry courses (Adults and paediatric courses available)

Please contact us at info@respiratorymatters.com for further information and an application form

## Spirometry for occupational health.

We offer a half day or full day course for those people working in an occupational health setting. The syllabus is similar to our foundation certificate course, but the full day course also includes additional information, including interpretation of spirometry traces that have been performed for screening purposes. The half day course just covers the performance of spirometry with no interpretation and therefore relevant for technicians. As well as the advertised dates, we are able to come and deliver this course in your workplace for which there would be a minimum fee payable. 

## Full Certificate in Spirometry (adults)

Any healthcare practitioner being asked to perform and interpret spirometry as part of their routine clinical practice should look to complete this certificate. This is a 2 day course.
