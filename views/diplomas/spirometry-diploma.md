This course is suitable for Health Care Professionals who are performing and interpreting spirometry. If you are interested in the ARTP courses, please refer to our Training Course section

The course's measurable learning outcomes have been benchmarked at level 4, using Ofqual’s regulated qualifications framework (RCF) level descriptors to allow participants to consider the depth of study, difficulty, and level of achievement involved. At the end of the course delegates will receive a certificate of achievement from NCFE.

You are also able to add the ARTP Full Certificate in Spirometry onto the qualification if you wish. 

### Learning outcomes

* Understand appropriate use of spirometry, including contraindications to the procedure
* Understand the importance of the verification of calibration of spirometry equipment, as part of the quality assurance    process, so that standards of measuring and recording, as specified in national guidelines can be met.
* Understand the terms used in measuring lung volumes
* Be able to obtain technically acceptable and reproducible measurements of dynamic lung volumes
* Be able to interpret spirometry tracings
* Be able to apply evidence-based practice through use of protocols
* Appraise an area of current practice by measuring it against pre-selected standards, in order to identify and implement   areas for change.

In addition to our planned courses, we are able to deliver our diplomas anywhere in the UK with a minimum of 5 delegates. We are also able to offer 1-2-1 traiing sessions resulting in the spirometry diploma. If you are interested in either of these options, please contact us to discuss your requirements.
