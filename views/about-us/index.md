Respiratory Matters was founded in 2011, and has provided training and education to hundreds of health care professionals in the UK.

In 2016 we were awarded the Quality Assurance Certificate from Health Education Yorkshire and the Humber.

Our mission is to improve the care and outcomes of people with respiratory disease through  evidence-based, practical, high quality education. We run our courses in Huddersfield with a maximum of 8 delegates to enhance the learning experience.

Our courses are accredited by the CPD certification service. Accredited CPD training means the learning activity has reached the required Continuing Professional Development standards and benchmarks. The learning value has been scrutinised to ensure integrity and quality. The CPD Certification Service provides recognised independent CPD accreditation compatible with global CPD requirements

We deliver asthma and COPD Certificate and Diploma courses,and spirometry Foundation, Interpretation and Full Certificate courses. As well as delivering courses every month at our training centre in Huddersfield,  we also work nationally with CCG's working with them to meet their respiratory education requirements and to support them following endorsement from NHS England that health care professionals performing and/or interpreting spirometry need to be assessed as competent to ARTP quality assurance standards.

We are able to travel nationally to deliver our courses.

In addition to education, we are frequently commissioned by  CCGâ€™s to lead on respiratory projects, and are involved in respiratory research.
