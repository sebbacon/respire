# Spirometry Courses

#### ARTP/BTS Spirometry Courses

As an ARTP approved centre we are able to offer 3 ARTP qualifications, the ARTP/BTS full certificate, the ARTP/BTS foundation certificate and the ARTP/BTS interpretation module. These qualifications include a written assessment, further details of which can be found at www.artp.org.uk. 

#### Accredited training (Non-ARTP)

All of our spirometry courses are accredited through our NCFE IIQ licence and can be done on their own merit without additional registration and certification with ARTP if you so wish. After completion of this training you will receive a certificate showing that you have attended an ARTP approved course, which you can use towards your portfolio of evidence should you decide to complete the ARTP certification within 12 months of completing the training course.These accredited, but non ARTP certificated qualifications do not include written assessment but you will be tested on clinical competencies during the study days. You may also decide to complete the Spirometry Diploma with, or without ARTP.(See Diploma section)

### Full Certificate in Spirometry

Any healthcare practitioner being asked to perform and interpret spirometry as part of their routine clinical practice should look to complete this certificate. This is a 2 day course.

#### Interpretation Module

For those that already have the ARTP Foundation Certificate, successful completion of this course with ARTP registration, will have the same weighting as the ARTP Full Certificate in Spirometry.

This course can also be taken by clinicians who do not perfrom spirometry but need to interpret it, therefore requiring the knowledge on how to do this effectively as well as a background of understanding. This is a 1 day course.
