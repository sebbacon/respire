Our diplomas are designed for qualified Health Care Professionals, such as GPs, Nurses and Pharmacists.

The modules are delivered by face-to-face teaching, and supported with distance learning materials and e mail/telephone support. There are formal assessments during and at the end of the study period. The assessments include audit and the development of protocols in practice, and are therefore an integral part of general practice. There is no unseen examination.

Modules are available on a free-standing basis or as part of a complete programme which can lead to a Diploma in that subject.

The courses measurable learning outcomes have been benchmarked at level 4, using Ofqualâ€™s Qualification and Credit Framework (QCF) level descriptors to allow participants to consider the depth of study, difficulty, and level of achievement involved. At the end of the course delegates will receive a certificate of achievement from [NCFE](http://www.ncfe.org.uk/).

Dates and venues are flexible to allow for busy working schedules, and can be delivered in GP surgeries if required. We currently cover the whole of the UK. To discuss your requirements please contact us.
