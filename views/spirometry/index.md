### New regulations for diagnostic spirometry

Healthcare professionals who intend to perform and interpret quality assured diagnostic spirometry (QADS) will have to be certified as competent to either perform spirometry, interpret the results, or both and placed on a national register with a reaccreditation scheme to ensure ongoing competency. This scheme, implemented by NHS England, gives practitioners until 31st March 2021 to complete this process and ensure that they are on this register. ARTP were asked to hold this national register.

If you are a CCG, or private company and would like to commission our services, please contact us on info@respiratorymatters.com

#### Spirometry Courses. 

Our spirometry courses are suitable for any health care professional involved in the performance and/or interpretation of spirometry. This includes those working in Primary Care, Secondary Care, Physiologists, technicians and those working in an occupational health setting. As well as attending the spirometry study days, if you need to be placed on the national register to comply with regulations within your workplace, you will also need to register with ARTP. You will then be required to submit a portfolio of evidence and for those people who have attended the foundation or full certificate course, a practical assessment will also need to be completed. On successful completion of the assessments you will receive the relevant certificate from ARTP and be included on the National Register of Certified Professional and Operators. You do not need to register before attending a study day, and no further training is required.

As well as the advertised dates, we are able to come and deliver this course in your workplace for which there would be a minimum fee payable.

## Full Certificate in Spirometry

## Interpretation Module

For those who already have the ARTP Foundation Certificate, successful completion of this course and then ARTP registration (and online assessment), will have the same weighting as the ARTP Full Certificate in Spirometry.

This course can also be taken by clinicians who do not perfrom spirometry but need to interpret it, therefore requiring the knowledge on how to do this effectively as well as a background of understanding. This is a 1 day course.
