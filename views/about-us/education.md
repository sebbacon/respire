Our mission is to improve the care and outcomes of people with respiratory disease through evidence-based, high quality education.

Respiratory Matters has been commissioned to provide training and education to hundreds of health care professionals in the UK. Educational sessions can be adapted folowing needs analysis.

We currently provide accredited courses in Asthma, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease and Spirometry, designed for qualified health care professionals. These modules can be free standing, or as part of a complete programme.

Currently awaiting approval, Respiratory Matters will soon be able to deliver three seperate Diploma courses in Asthma, COPD and Spirometry. These courses will be delivered in your locality, at mutually agreed times, to ease the difficulties that can arise when working and studying at the same time.
