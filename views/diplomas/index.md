The diplomas are available via elearning with 1-2-1 zoom tutorials or by 2 days of face-to-face teaching, supported with distance learning materials and email/telephone support. There are formative assessments throughout the study days and you will be required to submit written work 6 months after you have attended the study days. The assessment includes performing an audit and is therefore an integral part of general practice. There is no unseen written examination. There will always be a maximum of 8 delegates per study day to enhance the learning experience

The courses measurable learning outcomes have been benchmarked at level 5, using Ofqualâ€™s regulated qualifications framework (RCF) level descriptors to allow participants to consider the depth of study, difficulty, and level of achievement involved.  Our standards have been independantly audited by Health Education Yorkshire and the Humber for which we achieved the Quality Assurance Certificate.

There is also the option of completing certificate courses,rather than the diploma. The course content is the same as the diploma course and includes formative assessments throughout the study days, but does not require a submission of assignments.

We have scheduled dates at our training centre in Huddersfield, however we also offer the option of delivery in your own area, on mutually agreed dates. To discuss your requirements, please contact us.
