Sophie Toor, founder and clinical director of Respiratory Matters, has had a varied career in nursing from secondary care, community, holiday camps and the film industry. Prior to setting up the company she worked in primary care as a practice nurse and ‘inherited’ the role of respiratory lead due to the retirement of a colleague. At the same time, her daughter was diagnosed with asthma and her grandfather with COPD and from here grew her passion in respiratory disease and her vision to provide the resourses and knowledge to provide a positive impact to the lives of people with respiratory disease, their families and to the health care professioanls looking after them

Within her role as Clincial Director, Sophie still works as a respiratory clinician in primary care, writes and provides educational material around asthma, COPD and spirometry, heads several respiratory nurse interest groups, sits on advisory boards, works in research and has led local and regional respiratory projects.
