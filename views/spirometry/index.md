### Competency certification for diagnostic spirometry

Our spirometry courses have all been accredited by the CPD certification service. Accredited CPD training means the learning activity has reached the required Continuing Professional Development standards and benchmarks. The learning value has been scrutinised to ensure integrity and quality. The CPD Certification Service provides recognised independent CPD accreditation compatible with global CPD requirements. Competency assessments are included within our course structure, and delegates will receive certification once the assessments are successfully completed. The course content follows ARTP quality assurance standards.

In addition to this, if delegates wish to be placed on the National Register, which is held by ARTP, our course content will prepare you with this. Further details will be provided during the study day(s).

As well as the advertised dates, we are able to come and deliver this course in your workplace for which there would be a minimum fee payable.

## Interpretation Module

For those who already have the ARTP Foundation Certificate, successful completion of this course and then ARTP registration (and online assessment), will have the same weighting as the ARTP Full Certificate in Spirometry.

This course can also be taken by clinicians who do not perfrom spirometry but need to interpret it, therefore requiring the knowledge on how to do this effectively as well as a background of understanding. This is a 1 day course.
