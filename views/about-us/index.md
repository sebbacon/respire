Respiratory Matters was founded in 2011, and has already provided training and education to hundreds of health care professionals in the UK.

Our mission is to improve the care and outcomes of people with respiratory disease through  evidence-based, practical, high quality education.

We provide education nationally and have started working on projects with CCGâ€™s, many of whom have commissioned our study days and diploma courses in their locality.

Respiratory Matters have been approved as an [NCFE Investing in Quality (IIQ) centre](http://www.ncfe.org.uk) to give formal recognition to our courses which have been accredited under this licence. This licence gives assurance that the content of a training course is of a high standard and meets the rigorous assurance requirements of a national awarding organisation.

We have recently become a recognised ARTP Centre in line with recommendations of the Primary Care Commissioning (PCC) guidance on spirometry training in primary care.
