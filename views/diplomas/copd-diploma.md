This course is suitable for Health Care Professionals who are caring for people with COPD.

The course's measurable learning outcomes have been benchmarked at level 4, using Ofqual’s Qualification and Credit Framework (QCF) level descriptors to allow participants to consider the depth of study, difficulty, and level of achievement involved. At the end of the course delegates will receive a certificate of achievement from NCFE.

### Learning outcomes

* Recognise the signs and symptoms of COPD.
* Understand the principles of appropriate tests including spirometry to assist in confirming the diagnosis of COPD.
* Understand appropriate pharmacological and non-pharmacological management of a person with COPD.
* Be able to empower people with COPD to take control of their condition through gold standards reviews.
* Be able to apply evidence-based practice through use of protocols.
* Appraise an area of current practice by measuring it against pre-selected standards, in order to identify and implement   areas for change.
