Our mission is to improve the care and outcomes of people with respiratory disease through evidence-based, high quality education.  Each diploma has its own learning aims and outcomes which are stated in the individual distance learning materials.

## Learning with Respiratory Matters

Respiratory Matters was founded in 2011, and has already provided training and education to hundreds of health care professionals in the UK.

The diplomas are designed for qualified Health Care Professionals, such as GPâ€™s, Nurses and Pharmacists.

We currently provide modules in Asthma, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease and Spirometry. These modules are taught principally through distance learning materials and are supported by face-to-face teaching, mentorship in practice, and e mail/telephone support. There are formal assessments during and at the end of the study period. The assessments include audit and the development of protocols in practice, and are therefore an integral part of general practice. Modules are available on a free-standing basis or as part of a complete programme which can lead to a Diploma in that subject.
