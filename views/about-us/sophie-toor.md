Sophie Toor RGN, MSc, is the founder and clinical director of Respiratory Matters.  In 2009 her daughter was diagnosed with asthma and spent much of her younger years in hospital. At the same time her grandfather also developed COPD and from these experiences grew her passion in respiratory disease and her vision to provide education and resources to create a positive impact to the lives of people with respiratory disease, their families and to the health care professionals looking after them.

Within her role as Clincial Director, Sophie still works as a respiratory nurse specialist, writes and provides educational material to support the management of people with asthma and COPD, lectures at Huddersfield and Keele Universities, heads several respiratory nurse interest groups, sits on advisory boards, works in research and has led local and regional respiratory projects. She was a panel assessor for the National review of asthma deaths in 2012 and sat on the evidence review group for the BTS/SIGN update in 2016.
