This course is suitable for Health Care Professionals who are performing and interpreting spirometry.

The course's measurable learning outcomes have been benchmarked at level 4, using Ofqual’s Qualification and Credit Framework (QCF) level descriptors to allow participants to consider the depth of study, difficulty, and level of achievement involved. At the end of the course delegates will receive a certificate of achievement from NCFE.

### Learning outcomes

* Understand appropriate use of spirometry, including contraindications to the procedure
* Understand the importance of the verification of calibration of spirometry equipment, as part of the quality assurance    process, so that standards of measuring and recording, as specified in national guidelines can be met.
* Understand the terms used in measuring lung volumes
* Be able to obtain technically acceptable and reproducible measurements of dynamic lung volumes
* Be able to interpret spirometry tracings
* Be able to apply evidence-based practice through use of protocols
* Appraise an area of current practice by measuring it against pre-selected standards, in order to identify and implement   areas for change.
