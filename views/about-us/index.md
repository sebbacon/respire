Respiratory Matters was founded in 2011, and has provided training and education to hundreds of health care professionals in the UK.

Our mission is to improve the care and outcomes of people with respiratory disease through  evidence-based, practical, high quality education. We run our courses in Huddersfield with a maximum of 8 delegates to enhance the learning experience.

In 2016 we were awarded the Quality Assurance Certificate from Health Education Yorkshire and the Humber.

Respiratory Matters is also a recognised ARTP approved centre and we deliver spirometry courses every month in Huddersfield, but also work nationally with CCG's to support them with the new guidance that health care professionals performing and/or interpreting spirometry need to have the appropriate ARTP certiicate by 2021

We are able to travel nationally to deiver our courses.

In addition to education, we are frequently commissioned by  CCGâ€™s to lead on respiratory projects, and are involved in respiratory research.
