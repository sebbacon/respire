This course is suitable for Health Care Professionals who are performing and interpreting spirometry.

The course's measurable learning outcomes have been benchmarked at level 4, using Ofqual’s Qualification and Credit Framework (QCF) level descriptors to allow participants to consider the depth of study, difficulty, and level of achievement involved. At the end of the course delegates will receive a certificate of achievement from NCFE.

### Learning outcomes

* Be able to obtain technically acceptable and reproducible measurements of dynamic lung volumes
* Be able to interpret spirometry tracings
