Our diplomas are designed for qualified Health Care Professionals, such as GPs, Nurses and Pharmacists.

The modules are delivered by 2 days of face-to-face teaching, and supported with distance learning materials and email/telephone support. If you require extra face to face tuition then this can be arranged and there would be no extra charge. There are formative assessments throughout the study days and you will be required to submit written work 6 months after you have attended the study days. The assessment includes performing an audit and is therefore an integral part of general practice. There is no unseen written examination. There will always be a maximum of 8 delegates per study day to enahance the learning experience

The courses measurable learning outcomes have been benchmarked at level 4, using Ofqualâ€™s regulated qualifications framework (RCF) level descriptors to allow participants to consider the depth of study, difficulty, and level of achievement involved.  Our standards have been independantly audited by Health Education Yorkshire and the Humber for which we achieved the Quality Assurance Certificate.

There is also the option of completing a Certificate in Asthma, rather than the diploma, which includes formative assessments throughout the study days, but does not require a submission of assignments. Please refer to our training courses

Dates and venues are flexible to allow for busy working schedules, and can be delivered in GP surgeries if required. We currently cover the whole of the UK. To discuss your requirements please contact us.
