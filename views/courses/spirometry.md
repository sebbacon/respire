# Spirometry Courses

All of our spirometry courses are accredited by NCFE and can be done on their own merit without additional registration and certification with ARTP if you so wish. 

#### ARTP/BTS Spirometry Courses

#### Interpretation Module

This course offers the opportunity to become certified in interpretation. For those that already have the Foundation Certificate, successful completion of this course, will have the same weighting as the ARTP Full Certificate in Spirometry.

This course can also be taken for clinicians who do not perfrom spirometry but need to interpret it, therefore requiring the knowledge on how to do this effectively as well as a background of understanding. This is a 1 day course.
